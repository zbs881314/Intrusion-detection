# Intrusion-detection-network
For the NSLKDD dataset, you could downlod from https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html.  
For the AWID dataset, you could download from http://icsdweb.aegean.gr/awid/index.html.  
When you get the dataset, you could preprocess the dataset through reference the paper: M. Lopez-Martin, B. Carro, and A. Sanchez-Esguevillas, “Application
of deep reinforcement learning to intrusion detection for supervised problems,” Expert Systems with Applications, vol. 141, p. 112963, 2020.  
If you use the code, please cite the paper: Zhou, Shibo, and Xiaohua Li. "Spiking Neural Networks with Single-Spike Temporal-Coded Neurons for Network Intrusion Detection." arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.07803 (2020).
