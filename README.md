For the NSLKDD dataset, you could downlod from https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html.  
For the AWID dataset, you could download from http://icsdweb.aegean.gr/awid/index.html. 
For the pretrain weights, you could download from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/132Vq8WRfo1ozGl3-Pk7ZWE5XQpIXqpr0?usp=sharing.
When you get the dataset, you could preprocess the dataset through reference the paper: M. Lopez-Martin, B. Carro, and A. Sanchez-Esguevillas, “Application
of deep reinforcement learning to intrusion detection for supervised problems,” Expert Systems with Applications, vol. 141, p. 112963, 2020.
