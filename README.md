# Spiking Neural Networks with Single-Spike Temporal-Coded Neurons for Network Intrusion Detection  
   
The source codes implement the methods and results of the paper S. Zhou and X. Li, “Spiking Neural Networks with Single-Spike Temporal-Coded Neurons for Network Intrusion Detection,” arXiv: 2010.07803 (2020). Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are trained over the two network intrusion detection datasets.   
All the source data and pretrain weights can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/132Vq8WRfo1ozGl3-Pk7ZWE5XQpIXqpr0?usp=sharing.  
  
Alternatively, you can download the NSLKDD dataset from https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html, and download the AWID dataset from http://icsdweb.aegean.gr/awid/index.html.   After you get the datasets, you should preprocess them according to the procedure used in the paper of M. Lopez-Martin, B. Carro, and A. Sanchez-Esguevillas, “Application of deep reinforcement learning to intrusion detection for supervised problems,” Expert Systems with Applications, vol. 141, p. 112963, 2020.
